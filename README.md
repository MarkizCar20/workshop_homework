This is the workshop homework repository. The idea of this homework is for you to understand what a true development process feels like when contributing to an open-source project.
The rules of the homework are simple:
1) Create a fork of this repository
2) Clone the fork you created locally
3) Make some changes to the file structure and create a pull request
4) Try to collaborate with as many people as possible
5) Have fun!

Okay we covered the rules, but I want to ask of you one thing. In your fork, recreate the following file structure:

*   91453cd (HEAD -> main) not accepted changes, just create a PR next time
|\
| *   fdaa435 never merge something like this, use branches
| |\
| | * 682b95f more changes (again not wise to do this)
* | |   0e172a9 accept incoming change
|\ \ \
| * \ \   dfead20 (feature_branch) fix merge conflict
| |\ \ \
| | |/ /
| |/| |
| | * | 0d60f60 (feature_hotfix) did a hotfix
| * | | 718361c fix&add new code
| |/ /
| * | 00dd7ba add new feature to this branch
* | |   ff10c58 don't do this type of merge :)
|\ \ \
| * | | 2cb5238 something new was added
| |/ /
| * | 9b31587 add code feature 1
* | | 00af3b6 add new file of code
| |/
|/|
* | 2f486eb feature set on main
|/
* c77c89b add initial code

Good luck!
