This is the workshop homework repository. The idea of this homework is for you to understand what a true development process feels like when contributing to an open-source project.
The rules of the homework are simple:
1) Create a fork of this repository
2) Clone the fork you created locally
3) Make some changes to the file structure and create a pull request
4) Try to collaborate with as many people as possible
5) Have fun!

Okay we covered the rules, but I want to ask of you one thing. In your fork, recreate the following file structure:

Once you've created this structure, take a screenshot and sent it via PullRequest. I'll add all the screenshots to the repo :D
